# Bayesian-Optimisation-over-Categorical-Inputs-with-Target-Encoding-Methods
Many real-world functions are defined over both categorical and continuous variables.  To optimize such functions, we propose a new method that formulates the categorical variables as a continuous encoding variables, wherein each category corresponds to function value.
