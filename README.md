# Bayesian-Optimisation-over-Categorical-Inputs-with-Target-Encoding-Methods
Many real-world functions are defined over both categorical and continuous variables. To optimize such functions, we propose a new method that encodes the categorical variables as a continuous variables, where in each category corresponds to function value.
